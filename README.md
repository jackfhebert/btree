btree
=====

Implementation of a btree data structure for fun.
(I am still learning go, so I wouldn't trust what I've written yet.)

Current status:
Insert and Search seem to work under the given tests... but it is still
a work in progress.

TODO:
Add item removal.
Allow for binary search through item/children lists instead of linear scans.
Simple loadtest framework.
